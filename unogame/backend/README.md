Modified [prof'code](https://github.com/sfsu-csc-667-spring-2024-roberts/week-7/tree/section-1) to keep backend folder only

# Getting Started
Change directory to backend folder

`npm install`: install dependencies

`npm run build:dev`: build and develop the server 

`npm run start:server`: run the server in production mode after the build process is completed

visit `http://localhost:3000/`( temporarily using test page to check functionality of backend features
)
