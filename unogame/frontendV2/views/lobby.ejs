              The deck consists of 108 cards - 25 cards in each of red, green,
              blue, and yellow, with values of 0-9 in each color. There are also
              8 "Draw Two" and "Reverse" cards, and 4 "Skip" and "Wild" cards.
              Choose a dealer and deal each player 7 cards. Place the remaining
              cards face down in the center to form a draw pile. Flip over the
              top card to start the discard pile.
            </p>

            <p class="border-l-4 border-red-500 pl-4 mb-4">
              <span class="font-bold block mb-2">Playing the Game:</span>
              Players take turns matching a card from their hand to the card on
              the top of the discard pile, either by number, color, or symbol
              (symbols are Draw Two, Reverse, and Skip). If you don't have a
              matching card, you must draw from the draw pile until you get a
              playable card.
            </p>

            <p class="border-l-4 border-red-500 pl-4 mb-4">
              <span class="font-bold block mb-2">Special Cards:</span>
              Skip: When played, skip the next player. Reverse: Reverses
              direction of play. Draw Two: Next player draws two cards and
              misses a turn. Wild: Play any color you want and state the new
              color. Wild Draw Four: Player gets to choose new color and next
              player draws four cards and misses a turn. Can only be played if
              the player doesn't have a card in the color led.
            </p>

            <p class="border-l-4 border-red-500 pl-4 mb-4">
              <span class="font-bold block mb-2">Going Out (Getting Uno):</span>
              When you get down to one card left, you must say "Uno" to alert
              other players. Failing to do so results in drawing two more cards
              if caught. You can go out by discarding your second-to-last card
              if it matches the upcard, then discarding your last card. The
              first player to get rid of all their cards wins! Players score
              points for cards left in opponents' hands.
